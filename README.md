# DSP Exploration

This folder is going to organize my DSP based personal projects. I am currently interested in Audio DSP projects since they are easier to vizualize, but I hope to expand to more image/visual based projects with experience + classes.

Some ideas: 
* track to tabs 
* guitar tuner (software vs hardware)
* really small speaker (dynamic EQ reverse engineering, smart amp)
* Spotify API playlist generator on common words
* Synth modules - > table lookup oscillator 
* Image tracking
* Arpeggiator
* Noise types
* Optimize cup microphone
* Codable audio brick black box

Research topics:
* Because of quantizaton errors, digital synthesizers run into an issue w high frequency polyphony (such as partials and harmonics being registered slightly off as well as resulting in less samples per wave length) compared to analog.[High frequency inaccuracies] Is there a way to work around this? 
* How about aliasing in digital synths? Current methods have an aliased and antialiased version of a signal, but is there any alternatives?
* Is there such thing as synthesizers for modeling physics problems? (like wavetable oscillators) I am thinking of the graphic synths, that use audio input to model objects.
