# DSP Exploration

This folder is going to organize my DSP based personal projects. I am currently interested in Audio DSP projects since they are easier to vizualize, but I hope to expand to more image/visual based projects with experience + classes.

Some ideas: 
* track to tabs 
* guitar tuner (software vs hardware)
* really small speaker (dynamic EQ reverse engineering, smart amp)
* Spotify API playlist generator on common words
* Synth modules
* Image tracking
* Arpeggiator
* Optimize cup microphone
* Codable audio brick black box
